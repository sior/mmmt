mmmt - Magic Mouse MulitTouch

First you should disable emulate_scroll_wheel and enable report_undeciphered in the hid-magicmouse kernel module.  Run the following commands as root:
    modprobe -r hid-magicmouse
    modprobe hid-magicmouse emulate_scroll_wheel=N report_undeciphered=Y

The software needs to run as a user that can read files in /dev/input.
You will need libxtst.
