mmmt - Magic Mouse Multi Touch for Linux

This software allows you to  take advantage of the multi-touch features of 
Apple's Magic Mouse in Linux.  It is currently very buggy and only supports a limited 
number of gestures.

mmmt requires the XTest extension.

mmmt needs to be run as a user that has read permission on /dev/input/event*

The default behavior of the Magic Mouse will cause scrolling for all swipe 
gestures regardless of how many fingers are used.  To disable this, run the 
following two commands a root:

modprobe -r hid-magicmouse
modprobe hid-magicmouse emulate_scroll_wheel=N

When the program starts, the file mmmtrc, located in the same directory as the
executable,  is read to load the settings.  The default settings are:
Single Finger Swipe Up/Down/Left/Right - Scroll
Double Finger Swipe Left - Alt Left Arrow
Double Finger Swipe Right - Alt Right Arrow
Double Finger Swipe Up - Page Up
Double Finger Swipe Down - Page Down

Example of settings syntax:

Swipe Left Two Fingers
#Mouse Button:
Key Code:113
#Shift
Alt
#Control
#Super
Single Action
End Swipe Left Two Fingers

Lines with a # are comments and not processed.  In this example, when the user swipes to the left with two fingers, the program will simulate and alt-left arrow key press.  The ¿Single Action¿ line means that the event will only be triggered once for the swipe.	An event with that line commented out will occur continuously during the swipe (for example, scrolling).
